# FixMS

ASKAP utilities for updating MeasurementSets for external imagers.

ASKAP MSs are produced in a way that breaks compatibility with most other imagers (e.g. CASA, WSclean). Here we provide two modules (with CLI hooks) that fix the two stages that need to be applied to produce astronomically correct imagers with non-YandaSoft imagers:

1. `fix_ms_dir` : ASKAP MeasurementSets are phased towards the centre of field, but not the centre of its given beam. This utility reads the appropriate offsets to the beam centre from the `BEAM_OFFSET` and updates the `FIELD` table, as well as the phase and delay reference columns.

2. `fix_ms_corrs` : ASKAP MeasurementSets, as calibrated by the obervatory, provide correlations in the instrument frame. ASKAP has a unique 'roll' axis which means, in principle, the instrument frame can be at any arbitrary rotation on the sky. This utility applies the appropriate rotation matrix to the visibilities such the 'X' is aligned North-South and 'Y' is aligned East-West (IAU convention). Further, ASKAPsoft defines Stokes I as $I=XX+YY$, whereas most other telescopes use $I=\frac{1}{2}(XX+YY)$ (note this also applies to all other Stokes paramters). This factor is also corrected for here at the same time as the rotation.

## Installation

Obtain and install Python 3 (I recommend [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)).

Install the Python scripts:

Latest:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/AlecThomson/FixMS.git
```

Stable:
```
pip install FixMS
```

## Usage

```
❯ fix_ms_corrs -h
usage: fix_ms_corrs [-h] [--chunksize CHUNKSIZE] [--data-column DATA_COLUMN] [--corrected-data-column CORRECTED_DATA_COLUMN] ms

Fix the correlation rotation of ASKAP MSs. Converts the ASKAP standard correlations to the 'standard' correlations This will make them compatible with most imagers (e.g. wsclean, CASA) The new correlations are placed in a new column called 'CORRECTED_DATA'

positional arguments:
  ms                    The MS to fix

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --chunksize CHUNKSIZE
                        The chunksize to use when reading the MS (default: 1000)
  --data-column DATA_COLUMN
                        The column to fix (default: DATA)
  --corrected-data-column CORRECTED_DATA_COLUMN
                        The column to write the corrected data to (default: CORRECTED_DATA)
```
```
❯ fix_ms_dir -h
usage: fix_ms_dir [-h] [ms]

ASKAP utility - update the pointing centre of a beam in an MS. - Allows imaging by CASA or wsclean.

positional arguments:
  ms          Measurement set to update (default: None)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  ```
